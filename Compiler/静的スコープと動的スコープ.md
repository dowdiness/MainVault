スコープ

**Lexical scope**

**Indefinite scope**

生存期間

**Dynamic extent** refers to things that exist for a fixed period of time and are explicitly “destroyed” at the end of that period, usually when control returns to the code that created the thing.

**Indefinite extent** is everything else: things that get created, passed around, and eventually garbage-collected.
