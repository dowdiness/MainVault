# 1 Introduction

In 1987, Dana Angluin showed that the class of regular languages can be learned efficiently using queries.
This new approach is called ***minimally adequate teacher (MAT)***, learning is viewed as a game in which a learner has to infer a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) for an unknown regular language $L$ by asking queries to a teacher.

The learner may pose two types of queries:
1. “Is the word w in L?”(membership queries)
2. “Is the language recognized by DFA H equal to L?”(equivalence queries)

The L ∗ algorithm proposed by Angluin [5] is able to learn L by asking a polynomial number of membership and equivalence queries (polynomial in the size of the corresponding canonical DFA).
